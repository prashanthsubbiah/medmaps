# Intro
This repository has both front-end and back-end code in it.

React UI code resides inside `client` directory.

# Steps to run backend code
Make sure you are in the root path and execute below commands
1. npm install
2. node index.js

Above code would start server on port 4000

# Steps to UI code
1. cd `client` folder
2. npm install
3. npm start

This runs the react code on port 3000 in development mode with hot reload enabled.

Google maps API key is purposefully cleared. Please add it before you run the App.
